# Implementation Plan: Token-Efficient Symbol Editing

## Project Overview

This implementation plan outlines the steps to develop and integrate the token-efficient, chunk-based symbol editing capability into Serena. This feature aims to significantly reduce token consumption during code editing operations by allowing the transmission of only the changed portions of code rather than entire symbol bodies.

## Team Requirements

- 1 Backend Developer (primary implementer)
- 1 QA Engineer (testing)
- 1 Technical Writer (documentation)

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Dates |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Setup & Planning | 1 week | Week 1 |
| Core Implementation | 2 weeks | Weeks 2-3 |
| Testing & Refinement | 1 week | Week 4 |
| Documentation & Integration | 1 week | Week 5 |
| Release & Monitoring | 1 week | Week 6 |

Total duration: 6 weeks

- Test with mixed line endings in the same file
- Test flexible context length (strings vs lists)

### Integration Testing
- Test with different language servers
- Test with real-world code examples
- Test workflow integration

### Performance Testing
- Measure token usage reduction
- Compare execution times with traditional approach
- Benchmark with large symbols (100+ lines)

### User Testing
- Test with Serena team members
- Collect feedback on usability
- Validate token efficiency in real-world scenarios

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Risks
1. **Algorithm Complexity**: The chunk positioning algorithm might be complex to get right.
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing with varied code samples.

2. **Language Server Compatibility**: Different language servers might handle symbol bodies differently.
   - Mitigation: Test with all supported language servers.

3. **Edge Cases**: Unusual code formatting might cause issues with context matching.
   - Mitigation: Add flexible matching and comprehensive error handling.

4. **Line Ending Issues**: Different operating systems use different line endings (CRLF, LF, CR).
   - Mitigation: Detect and preserve original line ending style when modifying symbols.
   - Implement a robust line ending detection function that handles all three format types.
   - Handle mixed line endings within a single file.
   - Testing: Ensure the tool works correctly with all line ending types.

5. **Performance**: Processing large symbols might be slow.
   - Mitigation: Optimize algorithms and benchmark performance.

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

- Access to Serena codebase
- Understanding of Symbol manipulation in Serena
- Understanding of the custom chunk-based format designed for LLM usage
- Test environments with various language servers

## Post-Implementation Tasks

1. Gather usage metrics
2. Collect user feedback
3. Monitor error rates
4. Plan for potential improvements
5. Update documentation based on user questions

## Success Criteria

1. 80%+ reduction in tokens used for typical editing operations
2. No increase in error rates compared to full symbol replacement
3. Similar or better execution performance
4. Positive feedback from users
5. Adoption by LLMs as the preferred editing method for large symbols

### Sample Implementation

```python
# Pseudocode for the core algorithm

def apply_chunks_to_symbol(symbol_body, chunks):
    lines = symbol_body.splitlines()
    
    # Normalize all chunks to have list-based context
    for chunk in chunks:
        if isinstance(chunk["context_before"], str):
            chunk["context_before"] = [chunk["context_before"]]
        if isinstance(chunk["context_after"], str):
            chunk["context_after"] = [chunk["context_after"]]
    
    # Process chunks from bottom to top
    for chunk in sorted(chunks, key=lambda c: find_position(lines, c), reverse=True):
        position = find_position(lines, chunk)
        if position is None:
            return "Error: Couldn't locate chunk position"
        
        # Replace old lines with new lines
        lines[position+1:position+1+len(chunk["old_lines"])] = chunk["new_lines"]
    
    return "\n".join(lines)

def find_position(lines, chunk):
    context_before = chunk["context_before"]  # Now always a list
    context_after = chunk["context_after"]    # Now always a list
    old_lines = chunk["old_lines"]
    
    context_len = len(context_before)
    for i in range(len(lines) - context_len + 1):
        # Check if all context_before lines match
        if all(lines[i + j] == context_before[j] for j in range(context_len)):
            # Check if context_after matches
            expected_after_pos = i + context_len + len(old_lines)
            if all(lines[expected_after_pos + j] == context_after[j] 
                   for j in range(len(context_after))):
                return i + context_len - 1
    
    return None
```
